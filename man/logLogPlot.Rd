\title{Plot a log-log plot for read counts}
\usage{
logLogPlot(sce)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{A SingleCellExperiment object that contains read count data to be plotted. The read counts are extracted from an associated h5 file or similar data structure within the object.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object representing the log-log plot of read counts.
}
\description{
This function generates a log-log plot of read counts using the data from a `SingleCellExperiment` object.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assume `sce` is a SingleCellExperiment object with a 'counts' assay
plot <- logLogPlot(sce)
print(plot)
}
